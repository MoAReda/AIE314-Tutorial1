## Project Description
This project involves preprocessing unstructured data from various document types (PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, EPUB) and building a RAG bot capable of handling mixed media (text + images).

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have installed all dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    pip install python-docx docx2txt python-pptx PyPDF2 pandas requests beautifulsoup4 transformers faiss-cpu sentence-transformers pytesseract ebooklib
    ```

2. Place the document you want to analyze in the same folder as the code file.

3. In the code, find the section labeled **Example Usage** (around line 115). Update the `file_path` variable (line 117) with the name of your document. Then, modify the `question` variable (line 143) with the question you want to ask.

4. Run the code to see the results.

## Output Structure
The output is divided into four main parts:

1. **JSON Output:** This section shows a JSON representation of the document's content and metadata. This output is also saved in the `output` folder.
2. **Question:** Displays the question that was asked.
3. **Relevant Chunks:** Shows the most relevant sections of the document based on the question.
4. **Answer to Question:** Provides the final answer generated by the AI model.

## Example Output
```
--- JSON Output ---
# This part is saved in the output folder

--- Question ---
What is IoT?

--- Relevant Chunks ---
IoT Modules.
Towards a Definition of the Internet of Things (IoT)
IoT Development & its Applications

--- Answer to Question ---
A definition of the Internet of Things
