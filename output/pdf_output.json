Internet of Things for Architects: Architecting IoT \nsolutions by implementing sensors, communication \ninfrastructure, edge computing, analytics, and security . \nPackt Publishing Ltd, 2018.▪Chapter 2: IoT Architecture and Core \nIoT Modules.\n▪Chapter 3: Sensors, Endpoints, and \nPower Systems.\n▪Chapter 4 -8: Communications and \nInformation and Networks.\n▪Chapters 9 -10: IoT Edge,  Fog, and \nCloud Protocols.\n▪Chapter 11: Data Analytics and \nMachine Learning.\n▪Chapter 12: IoT Security. \n▪Chapter 13: Consortiums and \nCommunities\n\nInternet of Things –How? \nInternet of Things Principles and Paradigms\nBy: Rajkumar Buyya , Amir Vahid Dastjerdi\n▪Part I: IoT ecosystem concepts and \narchitectures\n▪Part II: IoT enablers and solutions\n▪Part III: IoT data and knowledge \nmanagement\n▪Part IV: IoT reliability, security, and \nprivacy\n▪Part V: IoT applications\nAssessment \nFinal -Term Exam 50\nCisco Certificates + AWS Labs   (Midterm)                   50\nAWS IoT: Developing and Deploying an Internet of Things\nInternet of Things –Why? \nInternet of Things\n\nIoT Market Share\nhttps://transformainsights.com/news/iot -market -24-billion -usd15 -trillion -revenue -2030\nIoT Architectures\n\nIoT Architectures\n❑IoT state -of-the-artarchitectures need tohave acertain level of\nadaptability toproperly handle dynamic interactions within the whole\necosystem Since mobility anddynamic change oflocation have become an\nintegral partofIoTsystems .\n❑Service layers include event processing and analytics, resource\nmanagement and service discovery, aswell asmessage aggregation and\nEnterprise Service Bus (ESB) services built ontopofcommunication and\nphysical layers .\n❑Web-based dashboards (orequivalent smartphone applications) for\nmanaging and accessing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) .API\nmanagement isessential fordefining andsharing system services .\n❑Lightweight data-exchange formats likeJSON canreduce theoverhead by\nreplacing largeXML files used todescribe services .This helps inusing the\ncommunication channel andprocessing thepower ofdevices more efficiently .\nIoT Data Management And Analytics\n❑IoT&TheCloud\nDue toitson-demand processing andstorage capabilities, cloud computing canbeused to\nanalyze data generated byIoTobjects inbatch orstream format .Apay-as-you-gomodel\nadopted byallcloud providers hasreduced theprice ofcomputing, data storage, anddata\nanalysis, creating astreamlined process forbuilding IoTapplications .\n❑Real-time Analytics InIoT&FogComputing\nThe processing and storage capability ofthese devices can beutilized toextend the\nadvantages ofusing cloud computing bycreating another cloud, known asEdge Cloud ,near\napplication consumers, todecrease networking delays, save processing orstorage costs,\nperform data aggregation, andprevent sensitive data from leaving thelocal network\nIoT Data Management And Analytics\n❑IoT-Cloud &Fog\n\nCommunication Protocols .\n\nCommunication Protocols ..\nThe publish/subscribe model isacommon way ofexchanging messages indistributed environments,\nand, because ofitssimplicity ,ithasbeen adopted bypopular M2Mcommunication protocols likeMQTT .\nIndynamic scenarios, where nodes joinorleave thenetwork frequently andhandoffs arerequired to\nkeep theconnections alive, thepublish/subscribe model isefficient .This isbecause ofusing push -based\nnotifications andmaintaining queues fordelayed delivery ofmessages .\nIoT Development & its Applications\nStandardization & Regulatory Limitations\nIoTgrowth ratewillcause difficulties forstandardization .Strict regulations about accessing\nradio frequency levels, creating asufficient level ofinteroperability among different devices,\nauthentication, identification, authorization, and communication protocols are allopen\nchallenges facing IoTstandardization .",
